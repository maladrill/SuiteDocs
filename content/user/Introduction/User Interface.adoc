= Interfejs użytkownika

Zanim przejdziemy do wyjaśnienia struktury i funkcjonalności SuiteCRM, 
omówimy elementy interfejsu użytkownika, aby zapoznać się z terminologią 
używaną podczas nawigacji w SuiteCRM. Interfejs użytkownika zawiera wiele 
elementów, więc podzieliliśmy je na różne sekcje poniżej.

== Elementy nawigacyjne

Zdolność do łatwego przeglądania i nawigowania w CRM jest kluczem do poprawy 
produktywności i wdrażania użytkowników. SuiteCRM ma przejrzysty interfejs użytkownika, 
zawierający różne elementy, które omówimy w tej sekcji.

=== Górne menu nawigacyjne

Górne menu nawigacyjne to główne menu, z którego użytkownicy będą korzystać 
przechodząc do modułów, tworząc rekordy i zarządzając nimi. Standardowy układ 
dla górnej nawigacji to lista 10 modułów. Kolejność tego menu zależy od kolejności 
modułów w menu Administrator → Wyświetl moduły i subdpanele. 
Górne menu nawigacyjne składa się z sześciu elementów. Są to:

* *CRM Name* – This is the name for the CRM which is specified on
installation. This defaults to SuiteCRM.
* *Module Menu* – This lists or groups the modules, dependent on the user
preference. This provides the ability for users to navigate to modules
within the CRM.
* *Desktop Notification Count* – This shows the number of desktop
notifications the user has not yet read. These can be managed by the
user. For full details on Desktop Notifications, see the
<<Desktop Notifications>> section within this
user guide.
* *Quick Create* – Quick create allows the quick creation of key module
records globally within the CRM.
* *Global/Full Text Search* – Allows users to search the CRM globally for
records/data.
* *User menu* – This displays the user name for the user currently logged
in. There is a drop down menu which gives users access to Employees,
their profile, the about page and a link to logout.

image:17Navigation_menu.png[title="Top Navigation Menu"]

To view a module, you can click on the module name. This will take you
to the List View of that module. For full details on views, read the
<<Views>> section of this user guide.

Hovering over a module name will produce a drop down menu. This drop
down menu displays the Actions and Recently Viewed records for that
module.

image:18Dropdown_menu.png[title="Drop-down Menu"]

You can edit records displayed in the Recently Viewed section of the
drop down menu by clicking the pencil icon. This will direct you to the
Edit View for that record.

image:19Recently_viewed.png[title="Edit Recently Viewed"]

There is also a grouped tab navigation structure for SuiteCRM. Users can
set this option in their user preferences. For full details on modifying
user preferences, see the link:/user/introduction/managing-user-accounts[Managing User Accounts]
section of this user guide.

image:20.png[title="Grouped Tabs"]

The grouped tab navigation menu gives the user the ability to group
modules within a tab such as the Sales Tab.

image:21Grouped_tab.png[title="Grouped Tab"]

=== Quick Create

You can click the 'create' icon in the top navigation menu to access the
Quick Create options. This is a list of commonly used modules with the
ability to create new records within these modules from any location.

image:22Quick_create.png[title="Quick Create"]

=== Sidebar

The sidebar is part of the responsive theme and is a user configurable
option. The sidebar can be expanded and collapsed by clicking on the
button highlighted below.

image:23Sidebar.png[title="Sidebar"]

[discrete]
===== Actions

This displays the Actions for the module you are currently viewing. For
example, if you are viewing the Accounts module, the actions that
display are: Create Account, View Accounts, Import Accounts. This
provides you with one-click access to module actions.

[discrete]
===== Recently Viewed

This section displays the last 10 records you have viewed. This leaves a
breadcrumbs trail so that previously viewed records can be quickly and
easily accessed via the sidebar. There is also the option to click the
pencil icon, which will take you directly to the Edit View of the
record.

== Home Page

The home page is the first page that is displayed to you
post-authentication. The home page has various elements that can be used
and configured such as Dashlets, Dashboards and the Sidebar.

=== Dashlets

Dashlets are user-configurable sections displayed on the home page that
give you a quick overview of your records and activity immediately after
login. This is particularly useful for sales and support led teams as
this reduces the number of clicks required to view/modify data.

Dashlets can be dragged/dropped within the home page. You can add
dashlets by clicking the 'Add Dashlets' link on the home page.

image:24Add_dashlets.png[title="Add Dashlets"]

Clicking on the 'Add Dashlets' link on the home page will open up the
Add Dashlets popup which allows users to select from a multitude of out
of the box dashlets.

image:25Add_dashlets.png[title="Dashlet Selection"]

To add one of the dashlets, simply click on the dashlet link. This will
add the dashlet to the user home page. The popup will remain if you add
a dashlet, to allow users to add multiple dashlets. Once you have added
your required dashlets, you can close the popup.

image:26Dashlet.png[title="Dashlet"]

You can modify dashlets by clicking the pencil icon on the desired
dashlet.

image:27Modify_dashlet.png[title="Modify dashlet"]

Clicking the pencil icon will display a popup. This popup will contain
all of the options that are configurable for the dashlet.

image:28Configure_dashlet.png[title="Configure dashlet"]

Once you have made the required changes in the dashlet configuration
popup, you can click 'Save' to apply the changes, or cancel if you wish
to revert to the current configuration.

{{% notice note %}}
Some dashlets require the home page to be reloaded. For dashlets
that require this, you will be notified.
{{% /notice %}}

=== Dashboards

Dashboards are new in SuiteCRM. These are configurable per user and can
be added/removed similar to dashlets. To add a dashboard tab, you can
click the 'Add Tab' link on the homepage.

image:29Add_tab.png[title="Add tab"]

Clicking on the 'Add Tab' link on the home page will open up the Add Tab
popup which allows users to specify a name for the tab and also how many
dashlet columns are required. You can opt for one, two or three columns.

image:192Add_tab.png[title="Add tab"]

Once you have specified the details for the dashboard tab, you can click
'Save'. You can also click 'Cancel' to undo any changes. Once you have
saved your changes, the Dashboard Tab will be added and will display on
the tab list on user Homepage. You can then add Dashlets to your new
dashboard tab.

image:31New_tab.png[title="New tab"]

If you wish to delete the dashboard tab, you can click the 'x' icon.
This will prompt you to confirm the deletion and then subsequently
remove the dashboard tab from your profile only. 

{{% notice note %}}
*Suite Dashboard*
is the standard dashboard tab which cannot be removed. You can however
configure the dashlets that display on that dashboard tab.
{{% /notice %}}

=== Activity Stream

The Activity Stream is an excellent way of keeping track of your
colleague's interactions with SuiteCRM. By default the Activity Stream
displays recent updates for the Opportunities, Contacts, Leads and Cases
modules. Your organisation's Facebook and Twitter feeds can also be
included in your Activity Steam dashlets if desired and this can be
configurable by an Admin user.

image:32Activity_stream.png[title="Activity stream"]

You can also comment about an update within the Activity Stream by
clicking on the Reply button on the right side of the post.

image:33Reply.png[title="Reply to post"]

Your posts can also be deleted from the Activity Stream by clicking on
the Delete button.

image:34Delet3.png[title="Delete post"]

Your comment will appear under the original post and will also be
timestamped.

The Activity Stream is also a useful tool for internal messaging within
your organisation, it is possible to send a message that will be
broadcast to all users in your network. To do this type your message in
the text field and click post.

image:35Activity_post.png[title="Activity Stream post"]

Your colleagues will see this message and will be able to respond by
clicking on the Reply button on the right side of the post.

image:36Reply.png[title="Activity Stream reply"]

Their response will appear under your post, again with a timestamp.

image:37Reply_view.png[title="Post reply"]

== Search

Searching is a vital aspect within the CRM as this allows you to quickly
define what it is you want to see. Many CRM's will have large data sets
so it is vital to you that you have a way to refine your search. In the
following sub-sections we will cover the various searching options
available to you.

=== Global Search

You can search all records within the CRM using the global search
functionality. You can search for records via global search by using the
search bar in the main navigation menu.

image:38Search.png[title="Global Search"]

Once you have entered your search term, you can press the return key or
click the magnifying glass/search icon. This will return records that
match the search criteria and categorise them by the modules available.

image:39Search.png[title="Global Search results"]

Modules can be added to the global search functionality by the System
Administrator.

=== Full Text Search

SuiteCRM has an option to enable or disable a full text global search.
The full text global search is powered by
http://framework.zend.com/manual/1.12/en/zend.search.lucene.overview.html[Zend
Lucene] search framework. The search works very similar to the standard
global search, but provides the enhanced functionality of searching text
in documents and other files, compared to the record-level search
provided by the standard global search.

{{% notice note %}}
System Administrators can enable/disable the full text search by
clicking on the AOD Settings link within the admin panel.
{{% /notice %}}

image:169AOD_Settings.png[title="AOD Settings"]

This will display the AOD option to enable/disable the full text search.

image:170Enable_AOD.png[title="Enable AOD"]

The search returns results slightly different to global search. Results
are returned in order of score. Records are scored dependent on how well
you match the search criteria provided by you – from 0-100%.

image:171Search_results.png[title="Full Text Search"]

=== Basic Module Search

Basic search is available on all modules within the CRM. Basic search,
as standard, allows users to search on the record name.

image:193Search_button.png[title="Basic Module Search button"]

image:194Search_box.png[title="Basic Module Search"]

Basic search also allows users to check the 'My Items' check box.
Enabling this option will only return records that are assigned to you.

image:195Search_my_items.png[title="Search my items"]

Once a user has searched for a record, the search will be saved. This
means that you can navigate to records and other modules within the CRM
but the search will not be cleared. If you wish to clear your search,
you can click 'Clear' and then click 'Search'. This will clear any saved
searches and return to the default result set for that module.

{{% notice note %}}
System Administrators can modify which fields are searchable in
Basic Search within Studio.
{{% /notice %}}

=== Advanced Module Search

Advanced Search is available on all modules within the CRM. Advanced
Search provides you with a more detailed module search functionality. As
standard, there are more fields available to you via Advanced Search.

image:196Advanced_search.png[title="Advanced Module Search"]

Advanced Searches may have many fields and specific criteria. For this
reason, You can save your advanced search criteria to easily populate
this in future.

image:197Save_search.png[title="Save search"]

To load a saved search, you can select the saved search from the 'My
Filters' drop down. This will return results that match the criteria
specified in the saved search.

image:198Saved_search.png[title="Saved searches"]

{{% notice note %}}
System Administrators can modify which fields are searchable in
Advanced Search within Studio.
{{% /notice %}}

== Views

Within the CRM you will be presented with various views. These views are
structured to present you with key information through the record
management process. There are three main views:

* *List View*
* *Detail View*
* *Edit View*

All of these views have specific purposes and these are described in the
sub-sections below.

=== List View

This is the view that you are presented with when you navigate to your
desired module.

image:40List_view.png[title="List View"]

The List View compromises of many actions that you can carry out to
manage records. These are:

* *Search Records* – provides you with the ability to perform basic and
advanced searches, as covered previously in the <<Search>>
section of this chapter.
* *Sort Records* – clicking on the column name will sort the record list
by that column either ascending or descending, if sorting is enabled.
* *View Records* – clicking on any hyperlinked data will take you to the
Detail View of the record.
* *Edit Records* – clicking the pencil icon will navigate you to the Edit
View for that record.
* *Delete Records* – you can select records and then select the delete
option to delete records from the module.
* *Mass Update Records* – you can select records and then select the mass
update option to update data on all selected records.
* *Merge Records* – you can select records and select the merge option.
This will begin the merge records processes. You can select a primary
record and then can merge the data from the duplicate records into the
primary record. Once saved, the duplicate records will be deleted and
all data/history merged to the primary record.

=== Detail View

This is the view that you are presented with when you view a record.

image:41Detail_view.png[title="Detail View"]

The Detail View compromises of many actions that you can use to
view/manage your data. These are specific to the Detail View of the
module that you are viewing. There are standard actions on the Detail
View for most modules. These are:

* *Edit* – allows you to edit the record you are viewing.
* *Duplicate* – allows you to duplicate the record the are viewing.
* *Delete* – allows you to delete the record you are viewing. If a record
is deleted, you will be redirected to the List View.
* *Find Duplicates* – allows you to begin the find duplicates process
where you can use system functionality to find duplicate records.
* *View Change Log* – allows you to view changes to audited fields.

{{% notice note %}}
Note: To set fields as audited and for any changes to find duplicates,
contact your System Administrator.
{{% /notice %}}

Hyperlinked fields can be clicked on. This will navigate you to that
record.

The Detail View is tabbed in SuiteCRM. This means there is minimal
scrolling and data is categorised for each module in the appropriate
tab.

{{% notice note %}}
System Administrators can select to display data in either tabs
or panels. You can contact your system administrator for more
information on managing layouts and views.
{{% /notice %}}

=== Edit View

This is the view that you are presented with when you edit a record.

image:42Edit_view.png[title="Edit View"]

The Edit View allows you to modify record information that is displayed
on the view. This allows users to update existing data and also
add/remove data. Once you have made changes on the Edit View, you can
click 'Save' to apply to changes or click 'Cancel'. Clicking either
options will redirect you to the Detail View of the record you are
editing. You can click the 'View Change Log' button. This allows users
to view changes to audited fields which can be useful before making your
intended changes.

== Record Management

We have covered the several views that you are presented with so we will
now move onto record management. In this section we will cover all areas
of record management so that you can efficiently store and manage
customer data.

=== Creating Records

You can create records within modules from various different areas of
your Interface. Detailed below are screen shots of record creation
points.

image:43Create_record1.png[title="Create Record method 1"]

image:44Create_record2.png[title="Create Record method 2"]

image:45Create_record_3.png[title="Create Record method 3"]

Once you click the create button, you will be taken to the creation
screen. This is essentially the <<Edit View>> that we have covered
previously in the this section. This
allows you to fill in the appropriate data for that record. Fields with
the red star(*) are required fields. Validation is performed so that a
record cannot be saved within the CRM unless data is valid for required
fields.

image:46Create_contact.png[title="Record creation"]

Once you have populated all data for the record, you can save the record
which will create the record within the module in the CRM. Once saved,
you will be redirected to the Detail View of the record you have
created.

=== Editing Records

You can edit records within modules from various different areas of your
Interface. Detailed below are screen shots of record editing points.

image:47Edit_contact.png[title="Edit Record method 1"]

image:48Edit_contact.png[title="Edir Record method 2"]

Once you click the edit button(or pencil), you will be taken to the Edit
View. This allows you to edit/populate the appropriate data for that
record. Fields with the red star(*) are required fields. Validation is
performed so that a record cannot be saved within the CRM unless data is
valid for required fields.

Once you have edited/populated the record data, you can save the record
which will update the existing record with the new data populated when
editing. Once saved, you will be redirected to the Detail View of the
record you have edited.

=== Deleting Records

You can delete records within modules from both the List View and Detail
View. Detailed below are screen shots of record editing points:

[discrete]
===== Detail View Deletion method

Deleting records from the Detail View is a simple process. You simply
have to click the 'Delete' button.

image:49Delete_contact.png[title="Delete Records"]

When you click the delete button on a record, you will receive a popup
which will ask you to confirm that you want to delete the record.

image:50Delete_contact.png[title="Confirm deletion"]

You can either click Cancel or OK. Clicking Cancel will revert you back
to the Detail View of the record and will not delete it. Clicking OK
will action the record deletion. If you choose to delete the record, the
record will be deleted and you will be redirected to the module List
View.

[discrete]
===== List View Deletion method

To delete records from the List View, you can select records using the
checkbox option on the left hand side of the view. It is possible to
select single records or use the 'Select this Page' or 'Select All'
options, to select all records from the page or all records within the
module.

image:51ListView_deletion.png[title="List View deletion method"]

Once the records are selected to delete, you can click the 'Delete'
button. When you click the delete button on a record, you will receive a
popup which will display the number of records being deleted and ask you
to confirm that you want to delete the record.

image:image59.png[title="Confirm Deletion"]

You can either click Cancel or OK. Clicking Cancel will revert you back
to the Detail View of the record and will not delete it. Clicking OK
will action the record deletion. If you choose to delete the record, the
record will be deleted and you will be redirected to the module List
View.

=== Mass Updating Records

You can mass update records from the List View of any module, given this
option is made available to you. To mass update records, you have to
check the records in the List View and then select the 'Mass Update'
option from the dropdown menu (next to the delete link).

image:52Mass_update_records.png[title="Mass Updating Records"]

Clicking the mass update option will display a screen at the bottom of
the List View. This will list all fields that can be mass updated by
you.

image:53Mass_update.png[title="Mass update"]

Once you have populated the fields you wish to mass update, you can
either click 'Update' or 'Cancel'. Cancelling the mass update will
cancel any changes and redirect you to the List View of the module.
Clicking update will update all selected records with the changes
specified in the <<Mass Updating Records>>
section.

image:54Mass_update.png[title="Mass update"]

=== Merging Records

You can merge records from the List View of any module, given this
option is made available to you, or via the Detail View if you follow
the 'Find Duplicates' process.

To merge records, you have to check the records in the List View and
then select the 'Merge' option from the dropdown menu (next to the
delete link).

image:55Merge.png[title="Merge"]

Once you have clicked on the 'Merge' option, you will be presented with
a merge screen. This will show the primary record and the duplicates
that you wish to merge with that primary record.

image:182Merging_records.png["Merge screen"]

You can select which record is primary using the 'Set as primary' button
on the right of the merge view. You can move data from the duplicate
records to the primary record using the '<<' buttons. In this example,
we have moved the First Name and Last Name from the duplicate record to
the primary record.

image:183Merging_records.png[title="Merge fields"]

Once you have made the required changes on the merge screen, you can
click 'Save Merge' or 'Cancel'. Clicking cancel will discard the merge
changes and will revert you to the List View for that module. Clicking
'Save Merge' will continue the Merge process and will prompt you to
inform you that the duplicate record will be deleted.

image:184Save_merge.png[title="Confirm merge"]

You can click 'OK' or 'Cancel'. Clicking Cancel will discard the merge
changes and will revert you to the List View for that module. Clicking
'OK' will save the merge and will redirect you to the Detail View for
the merged record.

image:185Saved_merge.png[title="Finished merge"]

As can be seen from the example, the merge has completed successfully.
The First Name and Last Name have been updated, and all other data has
been retained.

=== Importing Records

It is possible to import data easily by using SuiteCRM's easy-to-use
User Import Wizard. There are many hints and tips as you progress
through the Import Wizard on the requirements of importing data and for
further steps in the Wizard.

[discrete]
===== User Import Wizard features

There are many features of the Import Wizard which make it easier for
you to map data to CRM fields and also for future imports. These are:

* *Sample .csv file for easier import of data* — Use the available sample
.csv file as a template for import of files
* *Retain settings from previous imports* — Save/preserve import file
properties, mappings, and duplicate check indexes from previous imports
for ease of current data import process
* *Ability to accept both database name and display labels of drop-down
and multi-select field items* — Field labels as well as database names
are accepted and mapped during import, but only the field labels are
displayed for ease of use
* *Ability to accept both usernames and full names in user fields during
import and export of data* — Full names of Users displayed for Assigned
To and other User-related fields in exported .csv file for easier
identification of user records
* *Ability to auto-detect file properties in import file* — Upload import
files without specifying file properties such as tab, comma, double and
single quotes, date and time formats, making the process simpler and
faster
* *Ability to import contacts from external sources such as Google* —
Ability to import Google Contacts for person-type modules such as
Contacts, Leads, and Targets, relate SuiteCRM records to Google
Contacts, and communicate with Google Contacts from within SuiteCRM

[discrete]
===== Steps to Import data

{{% notice note %}}
Always import the Account data first and then import Contacts and
other data related to Accounts (such as Meetings, Calls, Notes) to

=== Exporting Records

You can export SuiteCRM records in .csv format. When you exports records
from the CRM, you will be provided with the .csv file to download when
the export has finished executing. You can save and open this file in
applications such as Libre Office Calc or Microsoft Office Excel.

The .csv file displays in a tabular format with columns and rows. When
data is exported from the CRM, the record ID is included with all other
fields that are specified in the export list for that module. You can
then use the record ID as a reference for performing a 'Create new
records and update existing records' import, as detailed in the
<<Importing Records>> section of the user guide.

{{% notice note %}}
When exporting values from drop-down lists, SuiteCRM exports the
ID associated with each option and not the display labels. For example,
if a drop down list has options labelled High, Medium and Low with an ID
of 1, 2 and 3 – the .csv file will show the drop down options as 1, 2 or
3.
{{% /notice %}}

[discrete]
===== Steps to Export Records

1.  Select the records from the List View on the module's home page.
2.  Select Export from the Actions drop-down menu in the List View.
3.  To export all records listed on the page, click Select located above
the item list and select one of the following options:
4.  This Page. To export all the records listed on the page, select this

page long), select this option.
6.  This displays an Opening.csv dialog box.
7.  Select Open to open the export file in .csv format or select Save to
Disk to save the .csv file to your local machine.
8.  Click OK to execute the operation. If you chose to open the file,
the csv file opens in Microsoft Excel.
9.  The file contains all the fields in the module from which you are
exporting the data.

== In-line Editing

In-line editing gives you the ability to change values “on the fly”.
In-line editing has been implemented on both List View and Detail View,
providing an advantage to users wishing to change field values quickly,
reducing the number of clicks/processes that would normally be taken to
edit the full record.

{{% notice note %}}
In-line editing can be enabled/disabled for both List View and
Detail View. This can be done in the main System Settings for the CRM,
by the System Administrator.
{{% /notice %}}

Once desktop notifications have been enabled, users will receive
notifications for any Calendar events such as:

* *Meetings* – Meetings you have been invited to that have popup reminders
set.
* *Calls* – Calls you have been invited to that have popup reminders set.

=== Managing Desktop Notifications

If you have no notifications, the notification count will show '0' to
tell you you currently have no notifications to check.

If you do not click on a desktop notification when it is displayed in
the browser, for example you are AFK(Away From Keyboard) your
notifications will be added to the notification list which shows as a
count on the main navigation bar.

You can manage your desktop notifications by clicking the icon which
will show any existing notifications.

You can either click the notification which will take you to the record
the notification is related to or you can click the small 'x' icon to
clear you immediately.

== Summary

In this chapter, we covered all elements of the SuiteCRM user interface.
There are many elements which you can use to optimise your navigation
and data management, to increase productivity.

In the next chapter, we will look at modules. Modules are the data
entities within SuiteCRM which can be standalone, or related to one or
many other modules. Each module has a different function but many
modules work together to structure and automate day to day business
processes.
